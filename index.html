      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Flashlight X ("the App") is a simple utility that enables the device flashlight/torch feature. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, why it is collected, how we use it, and the choices you have regarding that information. By installing or using the App you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
      <p>Flashlight X is designed to work without requiring you to provide personal information. Unless you contact us directly or opt into an optional feature (for example, to provide feedback), the App does not collect names, addresses, email addresses, or other personal identifiers by default.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Permissions & Device Features</h2>
      <p>The App requires a single device permission to function properly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera / Flashlight access</strong> — The App requests access to the device camera hardware in order to control the camera flash/torch. The App does not record photos, audio, or video. Camera permission is used solely to switch the flash on and off.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can revoke this permission at any time in your device settings; revoking it will disable the flashlight functionality in the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Automatically Collected Device Data</h2>
      <p>We may collect limited, non‑personal technical data automatically to help us maintain and improve the App. This data may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
        <li>App version and basic usage events (for example: app opened, feature used)</li>
        <li>Crash reports and diagnostic information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information is aggregated and does not contain personal identifiers. It helps us fix bugs, understand compatibility, and improve performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Ads, Analytics, and Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>The App may display advertising and may use third‑party services for analytics, ads, and crash reporting (for example services such as Google AdMob, Firebase Analytics, or similar). These providers may collect information about your use of the App as described in their own privacy policies. We do not control third‑party practices — please review their privacy policies for details.</p>
      <p>If you would like us to list specific third‑party services used in your published build (for example AdMob or Firebase), tell us and we will update this section with exact providers and links to their policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain automatically collected diagnostic and usage data for as long as needed to provide and improve the App, to comply with law, and to resolve disputes. Aggregated or anonymized data may be kept indefinitely.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child provided personal information through the App, please contact us and we will take steps to remove that information.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Links to Other Apps or Websites</h2>
      <p>The App may include links to external websites or other apps. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third‑party sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any site or service you visit.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data against loss, theft, and unauthorized access. However, no electronic transmission or storage system is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Permission control:</strong> You may revoke camera/flash permission in your device settings at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt‑out of analytics/ads:</strong> If the App includes optional analytics or personalized advertising controls, you may be able to opt out via the App settings or your device's advertising settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact:</strong> If you want to request deletion of any personal data you have provided, or have other privacy concerns, contact us (see contact section below).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective date" at the top of this page. Substantial changes will be communicated by updating this document and, where feasible, via a notice in the App or on the Play Store listing.</p>
